<p>Today we are going to go over some basic data visualization techniques using the Lahman dataset, dplyr, ggplot2, and ggiraph. Our goal will be to create a scatter plot that shows elite homerun hitters (that we will define as &gt;= 400 career homeruns) and a comparison of there strikeouts.</p>
<p>First, we must filter and summarize hitters that were able to hit 400 homeruns in their careers.</p>
<p>This gives us a list of players who were able to hit 400 or more homeruns. Notice that we named this table “df” so that we can easily refer to it throughout.</p>
<p>Next, we will join multiple tables together to make it easier to identify players. We will do this with the “inner_join” command.</p>
<p>We have named our new table HR_vs_SO.</p>
<p>Using ggplot and ggiraph now, we will graph the players homeruns and strikeouts.</p>
<p>Now, we have a nice graph that shows the relationship between the players and their homeruns and strikeouts.</p>
