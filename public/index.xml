      <description>Today we are going to go over some basic data visualization techniques using the Lahman dataset, dplyr, ggplot2, and ggiraph. Our goal will be to create a scatter plot that shows elite homerun hitters (that we will define as &amp;gt;= 400 career homeruns) and a comparison of there strikeouts.
Let’s start by loading the necessary packages.
library(Lahman)library(dplyr)library(ggiraph)library(ggplot2)Now, we must filter and summarize hitters that were able to hit 400 homeruns in their careers.</description>

      <description>Let us say we wanted to graph the weight of all baseball players to ever play. A nice display of this information could be in a histogram.
First, we need to install the necessary packages and call them in using “library()”.
library(Lahman)library(dplyr)library(ggiraph)library(ggplot2)Next, we can use our select function to select the players’s weights, in the “Master” table. We can also make sure that we exclude any players that we do not have data available for.</description>
